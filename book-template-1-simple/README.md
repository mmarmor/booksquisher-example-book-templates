# Booksquisher Example Book Template: book-template-1-simple

**To learn how to use this template, please read the [Booksquisher User's Guide](https://www.booksquisher.com/).**

## What is This? (TL;DR)

This Example Book Template is part of Booksquisher, a multi-format book creation system based on [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/) and the build scripts used to generate the open source book _[Pro Git 2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)_. Booksquisher consists of the [Booksquisher Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/marmor/booksquisher) which contains all the tools, the [Example Book Templates](https://github.com/mmarmor/booksquisher-example-book-templates) which you are looking at now, and the [Booksquisher User's Guide](https://www.booksquisher.com/) located at www.booksquisher.com.

## About This Template

This is the simplest of the example templates provided for use with Booksquisher. Even though it is simple, the AsciiDoc markup language syntax and book structure that it demonstrates is sophisticated enough to produce a vast range of well-formatted paperback novels and chapter-based books.

The template demonstrates not only the AsciiDoc syntax but also the build system, which can convert the source into nicely formatted, ready-to-publish versions in EPUB3, Kindle (KF8/MOBI), PDF, and HTML5 formats.

## Sample Output

The sample-output directory contains examples of this template after conversion with Booksquisher. The tools in the Booksquisher Docker image were used to create these output files.
