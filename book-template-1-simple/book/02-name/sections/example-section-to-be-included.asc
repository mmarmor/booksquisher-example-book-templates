When documents get large, it makes a lot of sense to break them up into many smaller files.
The content of this file will get inserted in Chapter Two.

It also makes sense to keep distinctly different parts of your document in separate files, even if they are in the same chapter.
For example, we have some computer generated poetry below, followed by a colossal quote.
Organizing in this way makes writing and managing your book much more manageable.

He gets on with life as a programmer,
He's a strong kinda chap.
He likes sewing dresses on Sundays,
He likes train spotting in the week.
He likes to contemplate Fords.
But when he starts to daydream,
His mind turns straight to BMWs.

How about a huge quote?

.Marcel Proust wrote this monster sentence with 192 words! 
[quote, Marcel Proust, Remembrance of Things Past]     
No doubt this astonishment is to some extent due to the fact that the other person on such occasions presents some new facet; but so great is the multiformity of each individual, so abundant the wealth of lines of face and body, so few of which leave any trace, once we are no longer in the presence of the other person, we depend on the arbitrary simplicity of our recollection, since the memory has selected some distinctive feature that had struck us, has isolated it, exaggerated it, making of a woman who has appeared to us tall a sketch in which her figure is elongated out of all proportion, or of a woman who has seemed to be pink-cheeked and golden-haired a pure "Harmony in Pink and Gold", and the moment this woman is once again standing before us, all the other forgotten qualities which balance that one remembered feature at once assail us, in their confused complexity, diminishing her height, paling her cheeks, and substituting for what we came exclusively to seek, other features which we remember having noticed the first time and fail to understand why we so little expected to find them again.
