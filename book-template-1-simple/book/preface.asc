This book exists as an example to help you learn to use the Booksquisher book creation system.

You may be looking at this text in its AsciiDoc source code form, **where this text appears between double asterisks**, or you may be reading it in a finished, ready-to-publish format, such as EPUB3, Kindle (KF8/MOBI), PDF, or HTML5, where that text is simply bold.

You can find the source code for this {booksquisher-example-book-template} on GitHub.

The book content is intended to be meaningless. In fact, a good chunk of it is computer generated nonsense. You can still learn a lot by studying how the book is put together, how the AsciiDoc syntax is used, and how the final output looks in various formats. The idea is that you can then use this template to create your own book using similar syntax and structure.

Please read the {booksquisher-users-guide} at www.booksquisher.com to learn about this Example Book Template and see step-by-step examples of how to use it.

_I hope you find Booksquisher and this template useful. If so, look me up at www.michaelmarmor.com and let me know! Getting a reaction from you--positive or negative--would mean a lot to me. All the best, and good luck! â€”Michael Marmor_
